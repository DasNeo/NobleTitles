# NobleTitles

An immersive mod for Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord: https://www.nexusmods.com/mountandblade2bannerlord/mods/2089/

Adds 4 different ranks of titles to sovereigns and their vassals (e.g., Duke Aldric), adjusted for culture (e.g., Khagan Monchug) and gender (e.g., Countess Elthild). Consorts also receive titles.
