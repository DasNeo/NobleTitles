# Noble Titles: TODO

- Add immediate title reevaluation when a clan joins/leaves a kingdom, either as a regular vassal or mercenary
- Add immediate spousal title evaluation upon marriage
- Add titles for mercenaries, whether part of a kingdom or not (Captain, High Captain, Headmaster, whatever)
- Add titles for the otherwise-untitled descendants of a King (Prince / Princess variants)
