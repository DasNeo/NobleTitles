# Noble Titles: TODO

## Definite

- Add immediate title reevaluation when a clan joins/leaves a kingdom

- Add immediate spousal title evaluation upon marriage

- Add titles for mercenaries, whether part of a kingdom or not (Captain, High Captain, Headmaster, whatever)

- Add titles for the otherwise-untitled descendants of a King (Prince / Princess cultural variants)

- Find a non-invasive way to override the vanilla strings for faction ruler titles, as they sometimes cause a redundant title to be displayed in conversational dialogue.


## Maybe

- Add optional MCM (Mod Configuration Menu) dependency for configuring some advanced titling settings, such as:

  - Add support for displaying a title as a suffix to a character's name instead of always a prefix, conditional upon culture
  
  - Option to display characters' full titled name, including their house/clan name (e.g, "Duke Aldric de Arromanc")

- More configurable titling options for total overhaul mods to use (e.g., more ranks, conditional title triggers directly specified in config, etc.)
